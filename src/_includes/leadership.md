# Leadership

I've been fortunate to hold several leadership roles in my career:

* Sr. Engineer with direct reports
* Engineering Manager with a team of 10 engineers
* Sr. Director with multiple teams and managers
* VP of Engineering at an early-stage startup with multiple teams

All of these roles have been different, but with the same common traits:

* B2B SaaS Startups
* Full-stack teams
* Work directly tied to revenue
* Team is exposed to customers and to other functions (Product, Customer, Ops)

I thrive in early-stage startups turning chaos into order while creating or increasing
revenue.

## System Design

I've played key roles in building several systems, including the [Numerator Insights](https://www.numerator.com/solutions/insights/) platform, as well as the [Seek Native](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZ1RH9UO/seek-ai-seek-native-agentic-ai-for-accurate-data-queries-insights) app. Outside of full-time roles, I continue to contribute my expertise in building web applications to my colleagues and to the open-source community.

## Tech Debt

I always advocate for a reasonable amount of technical debt: too much or too little,
and you miss deadlines (and revenue targets) because you haven't built the right for your customers.
In that vein, I've championed (and contributed to):
* A Python 2.7 to 3.6 migration (before containerization)
* Migrating from Vertica to Snowflake as an analytical warehouse
* Moving from AWS Cognito to Okta as a Single Sign-On solution
* Switching from enzyme tests to react-testing-library

## FOSS

I truly believe in free and open-source software (FOSS), and I continue to contribute
to the community. See the [Languages](#languages) section for examples.

## AI

I've worked with AI in several places, most recently at [Seek AI](https://seek.ai) where we
focused on using language models to understand customers' data. At Seek, I was a leader (manager of managers)
and active contributor in both the research & development of the ML systems.
