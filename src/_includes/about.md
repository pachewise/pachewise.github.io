# About

I've been working in software for over 12 years, starting from Lab Assistant
and Tutor jobs in college, and playing different roles on different teams:

* Building application frameworks at Oracle
* Helping build a Beta product that turned into Numerator's leading business line
* Managing multiple stream-aligned and centralized teams as a Senior Director
* Freelancing at small startups
* Leading Eng and ML teams at Seek AI

I love solving problems and thinking in systems and frameworks. I still live by my
old college's motto of "work hard, play hard."
