    Joining the Insights team has increased my appreciation for React and JavaScript, and leading
    the team since Nov 2019 has forced me to sharpen my React and Redux skills. I can fend for myself
    in JavaScript now, though there are still a <em>lot</em> of things that frustrate me (dependency hell, too many props). Currently working through Josh Comeau's <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/">CSS for JS</a> course.
