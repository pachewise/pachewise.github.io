<p>The latest trend is to write in Rust, and create bindings for your main language (for example, Python).
    I'm still very new to Rust, and the idiosyncracies are a little confusing, but I'm learning quickly. I'm currently
    working on a project with has a lot of Rust code, and so it's given me a chance to practice making small fixes.
